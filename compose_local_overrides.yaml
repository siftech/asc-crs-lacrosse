# This file is used just for exposing host ports for local Docker Compose development
# Competitors: You may modify this file to make local development easier.
# However, this file will not impact services at competition, only local development.

# We recommend you only bind ports to 127.0.0.1 in this file & have a GitHub action checking this.
# If you need to bind to other interfaces, putting a comment in this file containing only "exposed-port-check: disable" will turn off that check.
