# CRS

Competitors should place all source code unless instructed otherwise under this folder.

We may build this component out as more of a MockCRS in future iterations.

However it is intended that competitors will completely replace all code within this folder with their solutions.

The only additional changes to this repository should be to the

- `.github/workflows/crs.yaml`
- `compose.yaml` to reference your specific container/s.
- `crs/README.md` to assist your team with development.
- `crs/src/*` an example of where you could store your actual CRS code.
