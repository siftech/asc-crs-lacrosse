# Each item listed under "cp_targets" is treated as a CP repository
# to initialize in the target CP volume (e.g., ./cp_root)
#
# The "ref" element is optional. It indicates the git repository
# branch, tag, or commit that should be checked out. If not
# specified, it will default to checking out the "main" branch
# of the specified repo from "url".
