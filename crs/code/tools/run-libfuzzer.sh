# tgt is linked w/ the fuzzer lib and it essentially fuzzes itself.
# We customize the sift_harness.sh to work on the right harness, using it to wrap harness, to avoid the
# run.sh infra sending in just one file...which allows libfuzzer to fuzz starting from a corpus directory.
# Otherwise, the run.sh infra will send in one file and no fuzzing shall happen.
