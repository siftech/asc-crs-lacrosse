This could be due to heap corruption, passing a bad pointer to a heap function such as free(), etc. Since heap errors might include buffer overflows, use-after-free situations, etc. they are generally considered exploitable.","otherTags":"SourceAv (20\/23), AccessViolation (22\/23)","fpssClassification":null}}
