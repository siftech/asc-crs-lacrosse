;;; performance profiles are kept as hash tables internally, accessed by
;;; relevant dimensions of config, consd into list.
;;; - currently only handles count of goals/threats as config characterization
;;; dimensions

;;; - currently this means that we only store a single number, the
;;; number of seconds taken to plan.  We could also include the likelihood
;;; of finding a plan.  However, for now we'll just say that this
;;; is always a constant for any particular performance profile.... say,
;;; 80% like what we did in MDP experiments.

;;; performance profiles can be domain-specific, or default to
;;; *default-perf-prof-file*

;;; eventually this might lookup probability of getting an answer
