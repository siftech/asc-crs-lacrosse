;;; - open well-known socket, register w/ MM, and connect to all collaborators.
;;; - this works like the RTS's initialize_collaborations in collab.c
;;;     - the connection process is synchronized via single-threaded MM,
;;;     so when I call up, I see which of my collaborators have already
;;;     registered; those that have, I call up.  Those that havent
;;;     will call me when they register.
;;; - assumes *self* is bound to AMP object.

;;; Jan 28 2015 hacking this to be different for fuzzbomb, where the DVMs do not have well-known ports port-forwarded anymore
;;; so they have to do all the connecting outbound.
;;; So their algorithm is to repeatedly poll MM until they learn about all the FB and Optimus names, and then wait for them to connect.
;;; Conversely, FBs must get all the DVM registrations and connect to them.  This is likely easy b/c we now ensure, using
;;; require-dvms, that the DVMs are up.
