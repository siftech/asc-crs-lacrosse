;;; Contracts
;;;
;;; We now support different kinds of contracts, to support different kinds
;;; of negotiation protocols. Single-agent contracts mean that a contract
;;; is worked (awarded or claimed) by a single agent, as in bid/award/lock
;;; protocols (and other protocols TBD). Multi-agent contracts can be
;;; worked concurrently by any number of contractors. We may need to
;;; specialize further, but this seems to be a basic distinction.
